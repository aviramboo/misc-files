#### windows server with 2 nic and 2 gateway with no internet access:


Now you need to add the IP addresses of the NICs you don't want traffic to go out from using the netsh command.
netsh int ipv4 add address "Local Area Connection" 1.2.3.4/24 SkipAsSource=true
   
?Obviously the IP address and netmask should reflect the IP and netmask of the NICs you don't want traffic to flow from.
The SkipAsSource flag does two thing, first it tells Windows not to use that IP as the source address and second it prevents dynamic registration of the address in DNS.
   
To view the status of an IP and its SkipAsSource settings use the following netsh command.
netsh int ipv4 show ipaddresses level=verbose
