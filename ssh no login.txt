#create the public key in the home directory of the user which youi want to connect with

-Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host

            ssh-keygen -t rsa/dsa # -t is an optional flag

#if connecting with different user then root and it doesnt exist in remote server then creating user/password/home directory is needed on the remote server (for example nagios user)

-Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh-copy-id

            cat content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and paste it in .ssh/authorized_keys on remote host

-Login to remote-host without entering the password

Step 2: Create .ssh Directory on – 192.168.1.2
Use SSH from server 192.168.1.1 to connect server 192.168.1.2 using sheena as user and create .ssh directory under it, using following command.
[tecmint@tecmint ~]$ ssh sheena@192.168.1.2 mkdir -p .ssh

The authenticity of host '192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is d6:53:94:43:b3:cf:d7:e2:b0:0d:50:7b:17:32:29:2a.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.1.2' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
sheena@192.168.1.2's password: [Enter Your Password Here]
Step 3: Upload Generated Public Keys to – 192.168.1.2
Use SSH from server 192.168.1.1 and upload new generated public key (id_rsa.pub) on server 192.168.1.2 under sheena‘s .ssh directory as a file name authorized_keys.
[tecmint@tecmint ~]$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh sheena@192.168.1.2 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

sheena@192.168.1.2's password: [Enter Your Password Here]
Step 4: Set Permissions on – 192.168.1.2
Due to different SSH versions on servers, we need to set permissions on .ssh directory and authorized_keys file.
[tecmint@tecmint ~]$ ssh sheena@192.168.1.2 "chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"

sheena@192.168.1.2's password: [Enter Your Password Here]
Step 5: Login from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.2 Server without Password
From now onwards you can log into 192.168.1.2 as sheena user from server 192.168.1.1 as tecmint user without password.
[tecmint@tecmint ~]$ ssh sheena@192.168.1.2
